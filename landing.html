                <h4>Safari</h4>
                <p>Safari includes state-of-the-art features to help protect your privacy, defending you against
                    cross-site
                    tracking and minimizing the data passed to third parties. And Private Browsing adds even more
                    protections, such as locking your windows when you’re not using them.</p>

                <h4>Maps</h4>
                <p>Personalized features are created using data on your device. And data that is sent from your device
                    to
                    the Maps service is associated with random identifiers so Apple doesn’t have a profile of your
                    movements
                    and searches.</p>

                <h4>Photos</h4>
                <p>Face recognition and scene and object detection are done completely on your device rather than in the
                    cloud. This allows Apple to provide you with these advanced features without accessing your photos.
                    And
                    apps can access your photos only with your permission.</p>
